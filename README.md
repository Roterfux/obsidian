# Obsidian - a functional and elegant watchface for the Pebble Time

This is a functional and elegant watchface for the Pebble Time.  It's main features are:

- High contrast colors, clearly visible in most light conditions.
- Display of the current date (day and month) as well as day of the week.
- The date display is never obstructed by the watch hands.  If they would cover the date, the date moves slighly to the side.
- Display of the battery level.
- Change in background for low battery levels (yellow at 30%, orange at 20%, and red at 10%).
- Vibrates when the bluetooth connection is lost or regained, and shows an icon if no connection is available.
